# Duplicacy to Pushover Webhook

A lightweight PHP script that receives webhook POSTs from [Duplicacy Web Edition](https://duplicacy.com) and sends formatted backup reports to your [Pushover](https://pushover.net) account.

Ideal for homelab setups, it gives you instant mobile notifications after each backup — including job status, host info, duration, and data uploaded.

## 📦 Features

- Parses Duplicacy Web JSON webhook payloads
- Formats results with emoji and clarity

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Copy

Place the `duplicacy-report.php` file into a PHP-enabled web server (Apache, Nginx with PHP, Caddy + PHP, etc).

Example path:
```
/var/www/html/dup2push/duplicacy-report.php
```

---

### 2. Configure Pushover

1. Create a free account at [pushover.net](https://pushover.net)
2. Register a new application to get your **API token**
3. Get your **User Key** from your dashboard

Edit the top of `duplicacy-report.php`:

```php
$userKey = 'YOUR_PUSHOVER_USER_KEY';
$appToken = 'YOUR_PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN';
```

---

### 3. Set Permissions

Ensure the folder is writable so logs can be created:

```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/dup2push
chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/dup2push
```

---

### 4. Set Webhook URL in Duplicacy

In **Duplicacy Web Edition**:

1. Go to `Backup → Options`
2. Check **"Send backup report after completion"**
3. Set the **URL** to:

```
https://yourdomain.com/dup2push/duplicacy-report.php
```

✅ You may uncheck "Send report on failure" to get success notifications too.

---

### 5. Test with Curl (Optional)

```bash
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/dup2push/duplicacy-report.php \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"computer":"Test-PC","directory":"/home/user","result":"Success","start_time":1752937103,"end_time":1752937109,"uploaded_chunk_size":0,"uploaded_file_chunk_size":10485760,"uploaded_metadata_chunk_size":4096}'
```

## 🛠️ Notes

- Duplicacy Web Edition does **not** send logs via webhook, so log snippet shows "(No log available)".
- `duration` is calculated from `start_time` and `end_time`.
- Upload size is calculated by summing all three upload chunk types.

___

## 🔐 Security

- Do **not** expose this script publicly without restricting access or authentication.
- Consider limiting requests by IP or adding a shared secret token if needed.
